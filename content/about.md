##### <span>01.</span> About me
xx
Greetings!  Let me tell you what sets me above in the digital age, my excellent interpersonal communication skills and ability to work well with a wide range of personalities.  Combine that with a huge passion for all things in the Tech world.  Im always looking for a challanging opportunity with room to grow! I have dedicated most of my life to discovering, building, and innovating in the IT industry.  My work ethic keeps me motivated and Information Technology is what I love! Computers are my Passion!  

##### <span>02.</span> Interests and Hobbies

So let me just say I am your typical Nerd, but I can say I make Nerdyness look good.  I love video games, PC, PS, XBOX, ESL etc.  When im not in the digital world I love to fish, travel, rock climb, sports and skydiving. I enjoy meeting new people all over the world and discovering their culture and getting to know my fellow Human.  My greatest hope is that I can somehow contribute to uniting all of us in a common goal to better not just ourselves but the Human race as a whole.    

##### <span>03.</span> Frameworks and Technology

Although I am very adapative and love to learn new technologies, I would love to share my personal favorites.  
 - M.E.A.N Stacks are my ideal frameworks for Node development.
 - APACHE2 / Nginx for my Web servers.
 - Intel / Nvidia when it comes to PC's and Gaming
 - Ubuntu, SUSE, Debian are my best Linux distros.
